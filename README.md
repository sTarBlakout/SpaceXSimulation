This is a small SpaceX-inspired simulation I put together in my free time for fun.

You can tweak the behavior via `Data/SimulationConfig.asset` (ScriptableObject) and see how different settings affect the launch.

There’s also a Launches panel that pulls live mission/rocket/ship data from the SpaceX API.

The project builds and runs on Android.
